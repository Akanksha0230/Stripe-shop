# AI Assistance Notes

During development, AI-based coding assistance tools were used selectively for:  
- Clarifying Django and Stripe integration concepts.  
- Debugging issues (e.g., template filters, migrations, PostgreSQL sequence reset).  
- Suggestions on error handling and project documentation structure.  

AI tools were **not used to auto-generate the entire codebase**.  
All business logic, design decisions, and final implementations were written and validated by me.
